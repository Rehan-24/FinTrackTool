# v5.0.1 - Bug Fix: Removed Mystery "0" Text

## 🐛 Issue Fixed

The mysterious "0" text that appeared below every category on the dashboard is now gone!

## Root Cause

In the category display code, there was a `className="overflow-hidden"` on the outer div wrapper:

```tsx
// Before (v5.0.0)
<div key={cat.id} className="overflow-hidden">
  {/* category content */}
</div>
```

This was creating unwanted text nodes that displayed as "0" in the DOM. The `overflow-hidden` class was a leftover from when we were trying to fix spacing issues with inline styles.

## The Fix

Simply removed the `overflow-hidden` class:

```tsx
// After (v5.0.1)
<div key={cat.id}>
  {/* category content */}
</div>
```

## Why Did This Happen?

The "0" bug has been persistent across multiple versions:
- **v4.4.0-4.4.5**: Had `fontSize: '0'` inline style causing "0" to appear
- **v4.4.6**: Removed `fontSize: '0'` but left `overflow-hidden` class
- **v5.0.0**: Carried over the `overflow-hidden` class
- **v5.0.1**: Finally removed it completely! ✅

The issue was that React/Next.js was creating a text node from the class name or some browser rendering quirk with the overflow property.

## Files Changed

- `app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Removed `overflow-hidden` from category div (line 329)
- `app/dashboard/layout.tsx` - Updated version to 5.0.1
- `lib/version_notes.ts` - Added v5.0.1 notes

## Testing

1. Open Dashboard
2. Look at "Budget by Category" section
3. ✅ Should NOT see any "0" text below categories
4. ✅ Categories should display cleanly with just:
   - Category name with colored dot
   - Amount spent / Budget amount
   - Progress bar
   - Optional "Includes $X upcoming charges" (if applicable)
   - Optional "Over budget by $X" (if over budget)

## Before vs After

### Before v5.0.1:
```
Eating Out           $21.29 / $200.00
[━━━━━━━━━━░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░]
0                                    ← Mystery "0"!
```

### After v5.0.1:
```
Eating Out           $21.29 / $200.00
[━━━━━━━━━━░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░]
                                     ← Clean! No "0"
```

## No Migration Needed

This is a pure frontend fix. Just deploy and the bug is gone!

## Lesson Learned

When dealing with CSS spacing issues:
1. ❌ Don't use `fontSize: 0` hacks
2. ❌ Don't use `overflow-hidden` unless actually needed for content overflow
3. ✅ Use proper flexbox/grid with appropriate gap properties
4. ✅ Use standard spacing utilities (space-y, gap, etc.)

The cleanest code is the best code! 🧹✨
