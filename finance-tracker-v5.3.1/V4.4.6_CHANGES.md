# v4.4.6 - Dashboard Cleanup & UI Improvements

## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### 1. Mystery "0" Text Below Categories
**Problem:** Every category showed a "0" below the progress bar, even when there were no upcoming charges.

**Root Cause:** The parent `<div>` had `style={{fontSize: '0'}}` which was a CSS hack to prevent spacing issues. This hack created a text node displaying "0".

**Fix:** Removed all the unnecessary inline styles:
- Removed `fontSize: '0'` from parent div
- Removed `fontSize: '1rem'` overrides from child divs
- Removed `display: 'block'` and `display: 'flex'` inline styles
- Cleaned up the code to use standard CSS without hacks

### 2. Redundant Upcoming Card
**Problem:** The yellow "Upcoming" card was added in v4.4.4 for debugging but wasn't needed long-term.

**Fix:** 
- Removed the yellow "Upcoming" card from dashboard
- Changed grid from 5 columns back to 4 columns
- Kept the upcoming charges info shown under each category

## 🎯 Before vs After

### Before v4.4.6:
```
Dashboard Summary:
[Income] [Spending] [Upcoming] [Net Cashflow] [Total Budget]  ← 5 cards

Budget by Category:
Eating Out    $21.29 / $200.00
[progress bar]
0                                                              ← Mystery "0"!

Sidebar:
⚙️ Settings                                                    ← Gear icon
```

### After v4.4.6:
```
Dashboard Summary:
[Income] [Spending] [Net Cashflow] [Total Budget]             ← 4 cards

Budget by Category:
Eating Out    $21.29 / $200.00
[progress bar]
                                                               ← No "0"!

Sidebar:
📊 Categories                                                  ← Bar chart icon
```

## 🚀 Deployment

No migration required! Just deploy the code and the version number will update to v4.4.6.

## 💡 Why These Changes?

1. **Removed Upcoming Card:** It was added for debugging the duplicate issue but isn't needed in production. Users can see upcoming charges under each category.

2. **Fixed "0" Bug:** This was caused by a CSS hack (`fontSize: 0`) that was trying to fix spacing issues. The proper solution was to remove the hack and use clean CSS.

3. **Renamed to Categories:** "Settings" was misleading - the page manages spending categories and budgets, not application settings. "Categories" with a bar chart icon is more intuitive.
